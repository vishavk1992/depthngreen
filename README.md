# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## Features
- Responsive website
- Create React app with Vite + React
- Install and Configure Tailwind 
- Install `react-icons`, `react-router-dom`, `axios`
- Fetch API data with Axios
- Added Media Query to make it responsive on small devices
- To run on localhost : NPM RUN DEV

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`.
